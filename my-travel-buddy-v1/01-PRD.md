# My Travel Buddy — Product Requirements Document

## Project Name

**My Travel Buddy**

## Tagline

Plan smarter, personalize every day, and prepare for your trip in one place.

## Problem Statement

Travel planning is often spread across search results, screenshots, notes, and separate applications. Travelers need one place to generate, customize, save, and manage a trip itinerary.

- Signup, login, session check, and logout
- Save trip after authentication
- Saved trip dashboard
- Trip CRUD
- Activity CRUD

- Full checklist CRUD
- AI error handling

## Stretch Goals
